##SweetTest

Simple reimplementation of Rspec. This for fun and demo purposes only. Rspec is a source of confusion to many ruby newbies. The purpose of SweetTest is to show that Rspec is not "magic", it's just ruby ;)

#####Run tests:

```bash
ruby sweet_test_spec.rb
```
####Contribute? (Please do!)
Submit a pull request to:

- Make the code and test better.
- Add new implementation.

Everything must be tested, as much as possible, try to test-drive it.

File an issue to:

- Disagree with an implementation I have.
- Point out a bug in the code.
- Suggestions for specific matcher or expectation implementation.
